                         Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat
                         and are a vital means of transport for passengers
                         and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel.
                         The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population,
                         and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%.The Wild Bactrian
                         camel is a separate species and is now critically
                         endangered.

                            Chameleons are adapted for climbing and visual hunting.
                            They live in warm habitats that range from rain forest
                            to desert conditions, with various species occurring in
                            Africa, Madagascar, southern Europe, and across southern Asia
                            as far as Sri Lanka.

                            Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart,
                            short antennae, and membranous front wings.
                            They have an exceptionally loud song, produced
                            in most species by the rapid buckling and
                            unbuckling of drumlike tymbals.They typically
                            live in trees, feeding on watery sap from xylem
                            tissue. Most cicadas are cryptic.

                            The giant panda, also known as the panda bear or simply the panda,
                            is a bear native to south central China.Giant pandas in the wild
                            will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in
                            the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.

                            Pigeons are stout-bodied birds with short necks, and short slender bills.
                            In English, the smaller species tend to be called "doves" and the larger ones
                            "pigeons". Thirteen of the pigeon species are extinct.Unfledged baby doves and
                            pigeons are called squabs and are generally able to fly by 5 weeks of age.
                            The pigeon was used in both World War I and II, notably by the Australian,
                            French, German, American, and UK forces.
